        <p>
          We at bizzelevate.io ( a unit of BizzElevate Marketing Private Limited
          ) together with our affiliates (“we” or “us”) believe that protecting
          our customers’ and business partners’ privacy is crucial to our
          business and values. In the course of our business operations, we
          receive, collect, maintain, use and share personal data on customers
          and business partners. We are committed to protecting the privacy of
          individuals who visit our website (visitors), individuals who register
          to use our services (customers), and individuals who register to
          attend our corporate events (attendees) (collectively hereinafter
          “Data Subject(s)” or “User(s)”). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is
          to demonstrate our robust commitment to the Data Subjects’ right to
          privacy and data protection. This Privacy Policy outlines how we
          handle information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify
          a Data Subject (the “Personal Data”) and describes our practices in
          relation to the use of our website(s) and the related applications and
          services offered by us (collectively, the “Services”), as well as Data
          Subjects’ choices regarding their rights such as use, access and
          rectification of Personal Data. We act as a controller with respect to
          the information we process in connection with our business
          relationships. For example, we are the controller in relation to Data
          Subjects’ contact details and other commercial Personal Data. On the
          other hand, we may also act as a processor of Data Subjects’ Personal
          Data when our customer and business partners engage us to process
          Personal Data on their behalf, for example in connection with the
          provision of the Services. We may also act as a processor in certain
          circumstances when our customers use third party service providers in
          connection with our Services (e.g. Facebook). When we act as the
          processor, we process the data in accordance with applicable privacy
          laws and the data processing agreement entered into with the
          controller, where applicable. In such a case, please refer to the
          Privacy Policies of controllers for further information on the
          processing of Personal Data. Unless otherwise expressly stated herein,
          the terms used in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth
          in the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the “GDPR”).

          <b>1. Processing of Personal Data</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We process Personal Data of Data Subjects to offer the Services,
          including the processing and execution of demo requests relating to
          the Services, and to contact and market our Services to the
          participants of our business events and to contact and send marketing
          material to the visitors of our websites who submit us their
          information in a form or otherwise with the intent to receive
          marketing or other information from bizzelevate.io. In this context,
          Personal Data may be processed for market and customer analysis,
          reporting and statistical purposes, marketing purposes such as
          customized marketing, administration notices, database management and
          maintenance, product suggestions and offers, interaction with external
          social networks, access to third party services' accounts and
          platforms, heat mapping and newsletters. Personal Data may be used for
          direct marketing, including, where applicable, by electronic means
          unless objected by the Data Subject. Personal Data may also be
          processed to better understand how website visitors interact with
          bizzelevate.io’s website. Further, Personal Data may be used for
          invoicing and to send important information to the Data Subject e.g.
          regarding changes of applicable fees, price list and conditions, or to
          contact the Data Subject and provide information customized Services
          according to the interests of the Data Subject.
        </p>
        <p>We process Personal Data on the following basis:</p>
        <li>
          {' '}
          For the performance of the contract between us and the Data Subject
          (Article 6.1(b) of the GDPR);
        </li>
        <li>
          For the purposes of our legitimate interests related to the customer
          and business relationships between us and the Data Subjects (Article
          6(f) of the GDPR);
        </li>
        <li>
          {' '}
          To comply with legal obligations applicable to us (Article 6(c) of the
          GDPR, such as corporate and accounting).
        </li>
        <li>
          We may ask for Data Subject’s consent for the processing of certain
          type of Personal Data (for example for a campaign). When collecting
          such consents, we inform the Data Subject of the respective purposes
          of processing and such processing is conducted only when appropriate
          consent is received. We may ask for certain Facebook permissions
          allowing us to perform actions with the Data Subject’s Facebook
          account and to retrieve information, including Personal Data, from it.
          This allows our Services to connect with the User's account on the
          Facebook social network, provided by Facebook Inc. In this context,
          the following permissions may be asked: About Me, Access Rights
          (including but not limited to Ad Account Access, Business Manager
          Access), App Notifications, Contact Email, Manage Advertisements, and
          Manage Pages. For more information about the Facebook permissions,

          Data Policy.

          <b>2. Personal Data we collect and use </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          {' '}
          Personal Data processed by us is mainly obtained directly from the
          Data Subject. Provision of such Personal Data is necessary to use and
          purchase our Services, to accommodate Data Subject’s request for
          information relating to our Services and to organize communication in
          relation to our business events. We may not provide the Services to a
          Data Subject that refuses the processing of his/her Personal Data. We
          process also Personal Data accumulating from the use of our Services
          (including data collected under our Cookie Policy), and obtained from
          third party sources related to the Services. Personal Data may be
          updated and supplemented by collecting data from private and public
          registers. We collect the following Personal Data in conjunction with
          the Data Subject's (i) use of our Services, (ii) requests for
          information through our website and (iii) participation to our
          business events: name, phone number, e-mail address, usage data and
          cookies or any other information the user can provide via form (in
          website). In addition, we may process various other types of Personal
          Data generated in connection with the Data Subject’s use of any
          third-party services and applications as specified in the privacy
          policy of such third-party service or application. We for example use
          Hotjar’s technology services to understand our website users’ needs
          better and to improve user experience in our website (e.g. by
          understanding how much time our visitors spend on which pages, which
          links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and
          this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback.
          Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our
          users’ behaviour and their devices (in particular device's IP address
          (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size,
          device type (unique device identifiers), browser information,
          geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display
          our website). Hotjar stores this information in a pseudonymized user
          profile. Neither Hotjar nor we will ever use this information to
          identify individual users or to match it with further data on an
          individual user. For further details, please see Hotjar’s privacy
          policy by clicking on this link. Visitor can optout from the creation
          of a user profile, Hotjar’s storing of data about visitor’s usage of
          our site and Hotjar’s use of tracking cookies on other websites can be
          opted out by following this opt-out link. In our Cookie Policy, you
          can also choose to not allow certain cookies to be used. We do not
          collect sensitive information (Personal Data of special categories).

          <b>3. Disclosure of Personal Data</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          For the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, Personal Data may be
          disclosed, when necessary, to authorities, other companies within the
          same group of companies as us, companies which the group cooperates
          with and to other third parties, such as third-party service providers
          used in connection with our Services and services related thereto.
          Personal Data may be transferred outside the European Union and the
          European Economic Area (“EU/EEA”), including but not limited to, the
          United States of America, China, Australia, Singapore and Argentina as
          well as other locations and jurisdictions in which we conduct our
          business. Such transfers outside the EU/EEA are performed subject to
          appropriate safeguards such as standard data protection clauses
          adopted or otherwise approved by the EU Commission in accordance with
          the GDPR (“Standard Data Protection Clauses”). The applicable Standard
          Data Protection Clauses are made available for review to the Data
          Subject upon request.

        <p>
          <b>4.Retention Period</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We retain Data Subject’s Personal Data for 3 years from Data Subject’s
          latest purchase or contact with us. Personal Data may be, wholly or in
          part, retained for longer or shorter term if required by applicable
          law or if there is other justified reason to retain or delete them. In
          such a case, Data Subject’s Personal Data shall be erased with no
          further delay after there is no longer any need for such a retention.
          We evaluate the necessity and accuracy of the Personal Data on a
          regular basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>5. Data Subjects’ Rights </b>
        </p>
        <li>Data Subject has a right to request from us:</li>
        <li>
          Access to and rectification or erasure of Data Subject’s Personal
          Data;
        </li>
        <li>
          For restriction of processing concerning the Data Subject or to object
          to processing; and{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          to receive, under certain preconditions, Data Subject’s Personal Data
          in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to
          transmit those data to another controller.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Subject may exercise the aforementioned rights by sending a
          written request to us. Where the processing is based on consent, Data
          Subject has a right to withdraw such consent at any time. Please
          Policy that this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on
          consent before its withdrawal.
        </li>
        <p>
          In case the Data Subject considers that its rights under the data
          protection laws are infringed, the Data Subject may lodge a complaint
          with the supervisory authority of the Data Subject’s residence in the
          EU (e.g. in Finland the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>6. Security Safeguards</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Securing the integrity and confidentiality of Personal Data. We have
          taken adequate technical and organizational measures in order to keep
          Personal Data safe and to secure it against unauthorized access, loss,
          misuse or alteration by third parties, such as encryption, access
          controls and firewalls. Nevertheless, considering the cyber threats in
          modern day online environment, we cannot 100% guarantee that our
          security measures will prevent illegally and maliciously operating
          third parties from obtaining access to Personal Data and the absolute
          security of that information during its transmission or its storage on
          our systems.

          <b>7. Other </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time by giving
          Policy on the website and/or by other applicable means. It is highly
          recommended that Data Subjects check this Privacy Policy and the
          website every now and then, referring to the date of the last
          modification listed at the top of this page. If a Data Subject objects
          to any of the changes to this Privacy Policy, the Data Subject should
          cease using the Services, where applicable, and can request that we
          remove the Personal Data, unless applicable laws require storage of
          the Personal Data. Unless stated otherwise, the then-current Privacy
          Policy applies to all Personal Data we have about Data Subjects.
